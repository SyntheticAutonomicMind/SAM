# SAM Python Dependencies
# High-level requirements (pip-compile will resolve and pin all transitive dependencies)

# PyTorch (compatible with basicsr>=1.7 AND modern diffusers)
# Note: torch and torchvision are installed separately in bundle_python.sh
# Upgraded to 2.9.1 for modern diffusers support (Z-Image, FLUX, etc.)
# Successfully tested with basicsr 1.4.2 and realesrgan 0.3.0
torch==2.9.1
torchvision==0.24.1
