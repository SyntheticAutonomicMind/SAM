Export conversations or documents as training data, configure parameters like rank, alpha, learning rate, and epochs, then train adapters that enhance your models with domain-specific knowledge. Trained adapters appear as selectable models in the picker and can be used immediately for inference. Training is performed on-device using Apple's MLX framework for optimal performance on Apple Silicon."
